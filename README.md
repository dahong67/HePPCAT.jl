## What is Heteroscedastic Probabilistic PCA?

**HePPCAT** is a probabilistic **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** technique **for data that has samples with heterogeneous quality**,
i.e., noise that is [heteroscedastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heteroscedasticity) *across samples*.
It's not just a ["cool dude"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hepcat)!

todo: add example and demo ("**HePPCAT** estimates both underlying principal components and the noise variances.")

## How does it work?

todo: add short description
