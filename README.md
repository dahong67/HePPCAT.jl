Modern data often have samples with heterogeneous quality,
e.g., due to heterogeneous data sources/sensors/conditions.
The noise is [heteroscedastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heteroscedasticity) *across samples*.

`HePPCAT` estimates both underlying principal components and the noise variances.
