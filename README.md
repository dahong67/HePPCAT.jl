# HeteroscedasticPPCA (todo: rename?)

[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)
[![Build Status](https://github.com/dahong67/HeteroscedasticPPCA.jl/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dahong67/HeteroscedasticPPCA.jl/actions)
[![Coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/dahong67/HeteroscedasticPPCA.jl/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/dahong67/HeteroscedasticPPCA.jl)

Todo before registering:
+ [ ] external API
+ [x] split into smaller files
+ [ ] docstrings
+ [ ] run through `JuliaFormatter`
+ [ ] description in `README.md`
+ [x] rename to `HeteroscedasticPPCA.jl`

Further enhancements:
+ [ ] Add missing approaches: PGA line search, StGA constant step
+ [ ] Simplify/unify tests and benchmarks
+ [ ] Improve speed
  + #ebaa839 to #51326d4 had significant regressions for flat variant
  + #a6837d9 to #f5663c2 also introduced significant regressions across the board (question: does it have better numerical behavior though?)
    + some attempts that didn't work:
      + using `one` in hopes of encouraging type stability
      + using `zip` in hopes of discouraging bounds checking
      + creating a callable `RationalSum` type in hopes of discouraging unnecessary specializations of `roots`
      + skipping root-finding if the range is already less than the tolerance
      + using `Bisection` instead of `Newton`
    + some things to check/try
      + profile to see where time is spent
      + try version that clears the denominator but does not expand (i.e., don't form a polynomial in the canonical basis) - does the interval method somehow converge more slowly here due to the division?
  + Need to profile and understand where/why its slow
  + Maybe add specific implementations for this case
+ [ ] Maybe have `LipBoundU1` and `LipBoundU2` take data and output a function mapping an iterate to Lipschitz bound (might be cleaner and allows for pre-computation)
+ [ ] Put data in update method objects to unify and speed up?
