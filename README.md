## What is Heteroscedastic Probabilistic PCA (HePPCAT)?

**HePPCAT** is a probabilistic **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** technique **for data that has samples with heterogeneous quality**,
i.e., noise that is *[heteroscedastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heteroscedasticity) across samples*.
It's not just a ["cool cat"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hepcat)!

In the following illustration,
sample data points
consist of a first group of *noisier samples*
and a second group of *cleaner samples*.

Homoscedastic PPCA estimates only one noise variance for all the data
and treats them uniformly,
which can degrade performance.

**HePPCAT estimates *separate* noise variances for each group
*jointly* with the latent components
to improve recovery.**

## How does it work?
